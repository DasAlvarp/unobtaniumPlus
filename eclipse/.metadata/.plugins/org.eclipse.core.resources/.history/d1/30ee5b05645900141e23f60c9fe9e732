/*
phases of how a mod loads.

FML and MCF use and event system.


go thrugh library/cpwmods.fml/common/eventand then find stuff.

Pre-initialization phase is when FML loads configs, sets stuff up, etc...
That's where I set up blocks, etc.


Initialization: set up GUI handler, tile entities, start recepies, etc...

Post-initialization: will look at it later.
